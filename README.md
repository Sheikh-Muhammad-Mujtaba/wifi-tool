## Features
1. **View Available Networks**
   - Scans and displays all nearby WiFi networks in a tabular format with essential details like SSID, BSSID, signal strength, etc.

2. **Connect to a Network**
   - Lists available networks for selection.
   - Automatically checks if the selected network's password is saved. If not, it prompts the user to enter a password.

3. **Retrieve Saved Networks**
   - Displays a list of all saved WiFi networks along with their SSID, BSSID, and password.

## Future Plans

1. **Add Deauthentication Attack Functionality**  
   - Enhance the menu by integrating the deauthentication attack option for both Linux and Windows (where feasible).  
   - Allow users to select target networks interactively.  

2. **Enable Monitor Mode Functionality**  
   - Include a dedicated option to enable monitor mode on selected interfaces, streamlining wireless network analysis.  

3. **Disable Monitor Mode Functionality**  
   - Add the ability to stop monitor mode and restore interfaces to their default state.  

4. **Capture Handshake Data**  
   - Implement functionality to capture handshake packets for WPA/WPA2 networks.  
   - Provide user-friendly options to save captured data for further analysis.  

5. **Crack Handshake Data**  
   - Introduce a feature to crack captured handshake data using wordlists or brute force.  
   - Support integration with popular tools like `aircrack-ng` for efficient processing.  

These additions aim to expand the tool's capabilities, making it a comprehensive solution for WiFi network management and penetration testing.
